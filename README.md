The beginning of what is going to be a simple Chrome extension.
It replaces all images on a website into one of our beloved USC president
<b>C. L. Max Nikias</b>

TODO
---
1. Only replace images with nikias photos of similar dimensions, to prevent over-stretching the images
2. Add button in popup to enable/disable the extension

Changelog
---
* 1.0.0: Initial commit. Simply replaces all initially loaded images with a single photo of Max Nikias
* 1.1.0: Images will now be replaced with a random nikias photo. Now instead of replacing photos on page load, it will now wait until all the photos are loaded to continue with replacing photos.
* 1.2.0: Added button in the popup that display the number of images replaced on the site
* 1.3.0: Now works for sites with infite scrolling (Ex. Reddit, Youtube, etc.). Newly loaded images are now properly replaced. Made it so the popup automatically updates with the latest number.s
