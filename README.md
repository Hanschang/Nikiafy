The beginning of what is going to be a simple Chrome extension.
It replaces all images on a website into one of our beloved USC president
<b>C. L. Max Nikias</b>

TODO
---
1. Add more Nikias photo, replace photos into a random Nikias photo
2. Fix issue with newly loaded photos not being processed

Changelog
---
* 1.0.0: Initial commit. Simply replaces all initially loaded images with a single photo of Max Nikias
